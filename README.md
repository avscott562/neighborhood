# Scott Neighborhood Map (React)

## Description

This is an app that displays a map of local spas in Los Angeles, CA.  You can access the site at [Scott Neighborhood Map](https://github.com/avscott562/neighborhood).


## Dependencies

This site is dependent upon:
* Bootstrap
* React
* NPM
* Node.js
* Google Maps API
* Foursquare API

## How It Works

Upon initial loading, the app will display a list of the spas closest to and/or in Los Angeles, CA.  Associated markers will display on the map to designate where the locations are.

You can get location information (address) by clicking on the marker directly on the map or clicking on the name of the spa in the site list.

You can use the search field to look for a specific spa name.  Search results will be displayed in the site list and as markers on the map.
